 Fundraising Goal Report

 ## Overview of Project

Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. This report shows campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals.  

 ### Purpose

The intent of this analysis report is to explain Louise how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.  

## Analysis and Challenges

The campaign based on the theater outcomes by launch date is successful through the entire year, very especially in the months May, June and July. 

The campaign based on goals ranges amount, successful, failed, canceled, and plays shows that the best performance of successful happens under the ranges less than 1000, 1000 to 4999, 5000 to 9999, 10000 to 14999, and 15000 to 19999. The rest of the range from 20000 to greater than 50000 shows a higher number of fails while making all zeros to cancel. One of the challenges includes adding more criteria or variables to the analysis’ report. For instance, adding the subcategory “plays” reduces the number of successful to 141, and by taking it off of the dataset increases the number of successful to 322. This effect causes changes in all three measure outcomes successful, failed and canceled. Another challenge is the range of amounts that are given in the dataset. For example, if the first range would be less than 5000, this increases the number of successes. In conclusion, by modifying the range amounts, and by adding or taking out more measurement outcome criteria affect considerably the final report. Below are the charts that I used for this analysis. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

During the entire year the campaign was successful, especially in the months of May, June and July. Among the three measurements the total success in the entire year represents 61% compared to 36%, and with only 3 percent the cancellation. See below pivot table and chart.

 ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

 The campaign was only successful in the low range incomes which include less than 1000 with 76%, range 1000 to 4999 with 73%, 5000 to 9999 with 55%, 10000 to 14999 with 54%, and from 15000 to 19999 with 50%. The rest of the ranges show more failures than success, with cancel zeros. Below table and chart.

 ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

 One of the challenges includes adding more criteria or variables to the analysis’ report. For instance, adding the subcategory “plays” reduces the number of successful to 141, and by taking it off of the dataset increases the number of successful to 322. This effect causes changes in all three measure outcomes successful, failed and canceled. Another challenge is the range of amounts that are given in the dataset. For example, if the first range would be less than 5000, this increases the number of successes. In conclusion, by modifying the range amounts, and by adding or taking out more measurement outcome criteria affect considerably the final report.

## Results

 - What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

 The two conclusions stated below are based on the comparison of three components. Launch date, “theater” as one of the many categories, and outcomes which include three measurements successful, failed and canceled.     

 1. During the entire year the campaign was successful, especially in the months of May, June and July. 

 2. Among the three measurements the total success in the entire year represents 61% compared to 36%, and with only 3 percent the cancellation.   

   - What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The data report about specifically the outcome based on different amount ranges and based on successful, failed and canceled, and the subcategory “plays” shows as follows. The campaign was only successful in the low range incomes which include less than 1000 with 76%, range 1000 to 4999 with 73%, 5000 to 9999 with 55%, 10000 to 14999 with 54%, and from 15000 to 19999 with 50%. The rest of the ranges show more failures than success, with cancel zeros.     

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The conclusion based on the outcomes on goals ranges is limited to three  variables measurements (successful, failed and canceled) and a subcategory play. By adding more variables in the dataset, it is observed that the outcomes change in favor and against successful, failed and canceled. For example, when adding another variable in the dataset such as the subcategory “play” the report shows the outcome of success is reduced 141. On the other hand, when this subcategory “play” is taken out of the dataset, the outcome of success is increased to 322, this means 81 differences. So, in conclusion, depending on the variables added or taken out of the dataset clearly affects the outcomes of either successful, failed or canceled.         

 - What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

 
In the report there is a simple table, a pivot table, and two charts Line with Marker charts and Line Chart style 1. Other tables that can be created in the reports include a pivot table with filters for the outcome based on goals and ranges. Another simple chart that can be created in the reports is the Clustered Column chart which can be easily used to compare data. This clustered column chart gives the ability to filter based on ranges and also compare only two variables and one range, two ranges and more. This clustered column chart is very dynamic and interactive.
